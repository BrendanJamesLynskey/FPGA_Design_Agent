"""The "grill me" spec interview (owner feature, brief 05b).

The clarify stage asks **one question at a time**, each with a proposed default and the reason for it, until
``spec.yaml`` has no unresolved open question. Who answers:

- a human (``--interview on``, interactive): through a LangGraph interrupt; or
- the **spec oracle** (non-interactive runs): it holds a hidden full spec and answers only from it, saying
  ``not specified`` otherwise, in which case the proposed default is taken and marked ``defaulted``;
- nobody (``--interview off``): every question is defaulted.

Every question is recorded (asked / answered / defaulted, by whom), and the record goes into the build note and
``results/f2/``. The asker is the clarify sub-agent; this module holds only the bookkeeping and the oracle, so the
rules are tested without a model.
